## Lab Purpose and Components
In lab 8, students were asked to use skills they learned throughout the term. The new piece was that this lab included fetch and promises.

## What I Learned
Again, it was a bit confusing at first to wrap my head around what exactly fetch and promises were. But because the tasks regarding fetch and promises were somewhat simple, it was easier to get my footing in the new material and to feel like I had a preliminary understanding.
